# üõ°Ô∏è TryHackMe Progress

I am actively expanding my cybersecurity knowledge through TryHackMe, focusing on the Security Analyst and Security Engineer learning paths. These structured paths are helping me develop practical skills in threat detection, incident response, and security infrastructure management.

Key Areas of Study:

    Network Security: OSI Model, network protocols, and packet analysis.
    Threat Intelligence: MITRE ATT&CK framework, malware detection, and YARA rules.
    Security Tools & Techniques: Vulnerability scanning, log analysis, and basic penetration testing.
    Defensive Security: Monitoring systems, incident response strategies, and security hardening.

Current Focus:

    Completing hands-on labs to simulate real-world cybersecurity scenarios.
    Building a strong foundation in both offensive and defensive security concepts.
    Applying learned skills to practical cybersecurity challenges.

This repository will serve as a record of my progress, notes, and walkthroughs as I continue developing my cybersecurity expertise.
